/*
Prompt:
What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

Answer:
Exception handling is intentionally 'wrapping' specific
lines of code in a try/catch block. This allows the developer
to plan for exceptional circumstances, write custom error messages,
and allow the program to continue executing instead of crashing if
appropriate.
