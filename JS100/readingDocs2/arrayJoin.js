/*
Question:
How many arguments does the Array.prototype.join() method expect? 
What happens if you call it with less or more arguments? 

Answer:
Array.prototype.join()expects a single argument. If no argument is passed
the array elements will be joined into a single string with every element
separated by a comma. If a separator argument is passed EX: '-' the array 
elements will be separated by the provided argument. Any excess arguments
passed to the method will be ignored.
