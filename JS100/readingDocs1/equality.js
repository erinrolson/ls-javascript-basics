In your JavaScript console, execute the following two lines of code to check 
whether their return values differ and if so, how. 
Take a look at the MDN documentation on equality comparisons to 
read about how == and === differ.

'8' == 8;   // loose equality -> results in coersion -> returns true
'8' === 8;  // strict equality -> value and type must match -> return false
